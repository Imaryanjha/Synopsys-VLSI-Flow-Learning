# 🧠 Synopsys VLSI Flow Learning

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey of the **Synopsys Digital Design Flow**, covering end-to-end RTL-to-GDSII stages — from **synthesis to STA and PnR**.

## 🧩 Tools Covered
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **Design Compiler (DC)** | Logic synthesis & multi-V<sub>th</sub> optimization |
| **IC Compiler II (ICC2)** | Floorplanning, placement & routing |
| **PrimeTime (PT)** | Static timing analysis (STA) |
| **VCS** | Functional & gate-level simulation |
